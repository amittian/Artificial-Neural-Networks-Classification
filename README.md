Artificial Neural Networks : Classification

In deep learning, building, compiling, training, and evaluating a model are the core steps involved in creating and using a neural network. Here's a step-by-step overview of these processes, typically using a framework like TensorFlow with Keras

1. Build the Model
Building a model involves defining its architecture. This includes specifying the layers and the types of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions. Hereâ€™s an example using Keras:
