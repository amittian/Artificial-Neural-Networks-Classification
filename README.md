# Artificial-Neural-Networks-Classification
Building the model is a crucial step in the deep learning pipeline where you define the architecture of your neural network. This involves deciding the **number of layers**, the **number of neurons** in each layer, and the **activation functions**. Here’s a detailed explanation of these decisions, especially in the context of a text classification task.

##### Understanding the Components

- **Layers:** Layers are the building blocks of a neural network. Different types of layers (e.g., Dense, Convolutional, Recurrent) serve different purposes.

- **Neurons:** Neurons are the individual units within a layer that perform computations. The number of neurons affects the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.

- **Activation Functions:** Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn and represent complex patterns.

**Types Layer :**

- **Input Layer:** This layer represents the input data. For text classification, input data is typically text sequences.

- **Embedding Layer:** This layer is often used in text classification tasks to convert words into dense vectors of fixed size.

- **Hidden Layers:** These layers perform computations and learn from the data. They can be Dense (fully connected) layers or specialized layers like LSTM (for sequential data).

- **Output Layer:** This layer produces the final predictions. For binary classification, this usually involves a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function.

### Deciding on Number of Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions

**Number of Layers:**

- **Shallow Networks:** Few layers. Suitable for simpler problems or smaller datasets.
**Deep Networks:** More layers. Suitable for complex problems and larger datasets. However, more layers increase computational cost and risk of overfitting.

- **Number of Neurons:** The number of neurons in each layer depends on the **problem complexity** and **data size**. Common practice is to start with a **larger number of neurons** and reduce it in **subsequent layers**.

**Example:** If the first hidden layer has 128 neurons, the next could have **64**, and so on.

**Activation Functions:**
  
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Commonly used in hidden layers. It helps mitigate the **vanishing gradient problem** and allows the** model to learn complex patterns**.

- **Sigmoid:** Used in the output layer for **binary classification** problems. It squashes the output to a range between 0 and 1.

- **Softmax:** Used in the output layer for **multi-class classification problems**. It converts the **logits** to **probabilities** that sum to 100%.

# 1. Build the Model

Building a model involves defining its architecture. This includes specifying the layers and the types of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions. Here’s an example using Keras
```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
model = Sequential()

```
### Add layers to the model
```
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)))
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

```

# 2. Compile the Model
Compiling the model involves specifying the loss function, the optimizer, and any metrics you want to track. This step prepares the model for training.

```
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```
# 3. Train the Model
Training the model involves fitting the model to your data. You need to provide the training data, the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset), and the batch size (number of samples per gradient update).
```
history = model.fit(
    x_train,   # Training data features 	
    y_train,   # Training data labels	
    epochs=10, # Number of epochs	
    batch_size=32, # Number of samples per batch	
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val) # Validation data	
)
```
# 4. Evaluate the Model
Evaluating the model involves assessing its performance on a separate test set. This step provides an unbiased estimate of the model's accuracy and other metrics on new data.
```
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

print(f'Test accuracy: {test_accuracy}')

```
# Summary 

**Building the Model:** You define the structure of the neural network (e.g., number of layers, number of neurons, and activation functions).

**Compiling the Model:** You specify the loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy for binary classification), the optimizer (e.g., Adam), and the metrics to track (e.g., accuracy).

**Training the Model:** You fit the model to your training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size. You can also provide validation data to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training.

**Evaluating the Model:** You test the trained model on a separate test set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance.
These steps form the core workflow of developing a deep learning model using a framework like TensorFlow and Keras.
