Artificial Neural Networks : Classification

In deep learning, building, compiling, training, and evaluating a model are the core steps involved in creating and using a neural network. Here's a step-by-step overview of these processes, typically using a framework like TensorFlow with Keras

# 1. Build the Model

Building a model involves defining its architecture. This includes specifying the layers and the types of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions. Hereâ€™s an example using Keras
```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
model = Sequential()

```
### Add layers to the model
```
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)))
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

```

# 2. Compile the Model
Compiling the model involves specifying the loss function, the optimizer, and any metrics you want to track. This step prepares the model for training.

```
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```
# 3. Train the Model
Training the model involves fitting the model to your data. You need to provide the training data, the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset), and the batch size (number of samples per gradient update).
```
history = model.fit(
    x_train,   # Training data features 	
    y_train,   # Training data labels	
    epochs=10, # Number of epochs	
    batch_size=32, # Number of samples per batch	
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val) # Validation data	
)
```
# 4. Evaluate the Model
Evaluating the model involves assessing its performance on a separate test set. This step provides an unbiased estimate of the model's accuracy and other metrics on new data.
```
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

print(f'Test accuracy: {test_accuracy}')

```
# Summary 

**Building the Model:** You define the structure of the neural network (e.g., number of layers, number of neurons, and activation functions).

**Compiling the Model:** You specify the loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy for binary classification), the optimizer (e.g., Adam), and the metrics to track (e.g., accuracy).

**Training the Model:** You fit the model to your training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size. You can also provide validation data to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training.

**Evaluating the Model:** You test the trained model on a separate test set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance.
These steps form the core workflow of developing a deep learning model using a framework like TensorFlow and Keras.
